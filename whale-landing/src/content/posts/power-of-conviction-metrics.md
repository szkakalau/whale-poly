# Beyond Volume

In traditional finance, volume is king. In prediction markets, **Conviction** is God.

What is conviction? It's not just the amount of money bet; it's the *context* of that bet.

## Measuring Conviction

At Whale Intelligence, we calculate conviction based on:

1.  **Portfolio Concentration**: Is this bet 1% of their portfolio or 50%? A whale putting half their bankroll on a single outcome screams high conviction.
2.  **Duration**: How long have they held? "Diamond hands" (holding through volatility) indicates a belief in the fundamental outcome, not just a quick scalp.
3.  **Price Insensitivity**: Are they buying at market price (taking liquidity) or waiting for limit orders? Aggressive market buying shows urgency and high confidence.

## Using the Conviction Dashboard

Our **Conviction** page ranks active markets by the aggregate conviction of top-tier whales. 

- **High Conviction, Low Probability**: These are the "Dark Horses." Markets where the crowd thinks "No," but the smartest whales are betting "Yes." These offer the highest asymmetric upside.
- **Diverging Conviction**: When Whale A and Whale B (both high scores) are on opposite sides. These are battlegrounds to avoid or trade with extreme caution.

Use conviction as your compass in the sea of noise.
