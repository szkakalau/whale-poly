# Profiling the Invisible

Every wallet tells a story. On the blockchain, nothing is truly hidden if you know where to look. At Whale Intelligence, we spend thousands of hours profiling wallet behaviors.

## The "Sniper"

- **Behavior**: Dormant for weeks. Wakes up, executes one massive trade, goes back to sleep.
- **Implication**: Extremely high confidence. Likely possesses specific, time-sensitive information.
- **Action**: Follow immediately.

## The "Grinder"

- **Behavior**: Thousands of small trades. Arbitraging small price differences across related markets.
- **Implication**: Likely a bot or a quantitative firm.
- **Action**: Hard to copy. They win on speed and low margins. Useful for gauging "fair value."

## The "Insider"

- **Behavior**: New wallet. Funded from a CEX (Centralized Exchange). Buys max limit on a niche market.
- **Implication**: Trying to hide identity. High risk, high reward.
- **Action**: Monitor closely. Often a binary outcome play.

## Using the Dashboard

When you click on a specific Whale Profile in our app, look at their **Activity Heatmap**. 
- Do they trade only on weekdays? (Professional)
- Do they trade 24/7? (Bot/Team)
- Do they trade only 5 minutes before close? (Sniper)

Understanding *who* is behind the wallet helps you decide whether to follow them.
