# The First Rule: Don't Blow Up

Prediction markets are binary. You either win (100) or you lose (0). This "all-or-nothing" nature makes them incredibly volatile and dangerous for the unprepared.

## The Kelly Criterion

The gold standard for sizing bets is the Kelly Criterion, but in prediction markets, you should use "Fractional Kelly."

*Never bet more than you can afford to lose.* It sounds cliché, but in binary markets, a "sure thing" can go to zero in seconds due to a technicality or unexpected news.

## Diversification vs. Concentration

- **Whales** often concentrate. They have deep pockets and inside info.
- **You** should likely diversify. Spread your capital across uncorrelated markets (e.g., one election, one crypto price, one sports game).

## The Stop-Loss Myth

Stop-losses are hard to execute in illiquid prediction markets. Slippage can kill you. Instead, use **Position Sizing** as your stop loss. If you put 5% of your portfolio on a trade, your maximum loss is 5%.

## Managing "Binary Risk"

Remember that prediction markets often resolve on specific wording. 
- "Will Bitcoin hit $100k in 2024?"
- If it hits $99,999.99, you lose. 

Always read the **Rules** of the market carefully. Smart money reads the fine print. Dumb money reads the title.
