# The Importance of Backtesting

Would you drive a car that had never been safety tested? Probably not. Yet, many traders deploy thousands of dollars into strategies based on "gut feeling."

At Whale Intelligence, we believe in data-driven decision making. That's why we built our **Backtesting Engine**.

## What Can You Backtest?

Our platform allows you to query historical data to answer questions like:

- *"How profitable are whales with a score > 80 in political markets?"*
- *"What is the win rate of 'No' bets placed 24 hours before market close?"*
- *"Do whales perform better in Sports or Crypto markets?"*

## A Simple Strategy Example

Let's say you have a theory: **"Follow the biggest whale in low-liquidity markets."**

Using our tools, you can look back at the last 6 months of data:
1. Filter for markets with < \$100k volume.
2. Identify the top holder.
3. Calculate their ROI.

If the data shows a negative return, you've just saved yourself money. If it's positive, you have a verified edge.

## Continuous Improvement

Markets change. A strategy that worked in 2023 might fail in 2024. Regular backtesting ensures your edge remains sharp. Use our **Performance** page to keep your strategies honest.
