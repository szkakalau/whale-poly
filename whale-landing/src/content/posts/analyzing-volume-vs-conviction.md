# Volume is Vanity, Conviction is Sanity

A common mistake new traders make is equating high volume with a strong trend. In prediction markets, high volume can sometimes mean *indecision* or a fierce battle between two sides.

## The Volume Trap

Imagine a market with $10M in volume but the price has been stuck at 50 cents for a week. This indicates high disagreement. Bulls and bears are fighting, but neither is winning. This is a dangerous place to be.

## The Conviction Signal

Conviction is defined by **directional flow** relative to liquidity.
- **High Conviction**: Price moves up on moderate volume, and pullbacks are shallow. Or, large limit orders act as a "buy wall," absorbing all selling pressure.
- **Low Conviction**: Price spikes on low volume but immediately retraces.

## Using the Whale Intelligence Dashboard

Our dashboard separates "Raw Volume" from "Net Flow."
- **Raw Volume**: Total dollars traded. Good for liquidity, bad for direction.
- **Net Flow**: The difference between buying and selling pressure.
- **Whale Score**: A weighted metric that considers the *quality* of the volume.

Look for divergence. If price is flat but Net Flow and Whale Score are rising, a breakout is often imminent.
