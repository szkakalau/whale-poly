# The World's Truth Machine

Prediction markets are not casinos. They are information aggregators. 

In a casino, the house always wins. In a prediction market, the person with the best information wins. This subtle difference changes everything.

## How It Works

Prices in a prediction market represent probabilities. If a "Yes" share costs \$0.60, the market is saying there is a 60% chance of that event happening.

- If you think the real probability is 80%, you buy (long).
- If you think it's 40%, you sell (short) or buy "No".

## Why It Works

The "Efficient Market Hypothesis" suggests that prices reflect all available information. Prediction markets incentivize participants to bring *new* information to the table.

- **Insider Knowledge**: Someone close to a campaign or company might trade on private info.
- **Data Analysis**: Quants might build models that outperform public polls.
- **Research**: Diligent researchers might find obscure documents that contradict the narrative.

## Your Role

You don't need to be an insider to win. You just need to be observant. By using tools like **Whale Intelligence**, you can leverage the information others have already brought to the market.

When a whale bets big, they are essentially saying, "I have information that justifies this risk." Our platform lets you listen to what they are saying.
