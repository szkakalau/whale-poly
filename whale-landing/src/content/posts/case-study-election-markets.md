# When Polls Fail, Markets Lead

Elections are the Super Bowl of prediction markets. They offer high liquidity and attract the most sophisticated actors.

In recent cycles, we've observed a consistent pattern: **Whale Wallets move before the polls.**

## The "Debate Dip" Phenomenon

In a recent primary debate, while pundits were arguing on TV, a cluster of top-tier whales began aggressively shorting a leading candidate.

- **Timeline**: 
    - 8:15 PM: Whales start selling Candidate A.
    - 8:30 PM: Candidate A makes a gaffe on stage.
    - 8:45 PM: Twitter reacts, price crashes.

The whales didn't know the gaffe would happen, but they knew the candidate's vulnerability and were positioned to react instantly, or perhaps had private polling data showing weakness.

## The "Dropout" Signal

One of our most profitable signals occurred when a candidate was rumored to drop out.
- Public sentiment: "They will never quit!"
- Whale Action: Massive "No" buys on "Will Candidate X be the nominee?"
- Result: Candidate dropped out 48 hours later.

## Lessons Learned

1.  **Sentiment lags Reality**: People believe what they want to believe until the end.
2.  **Money leads News**: Someone always knows first.
3.  **Aggregated Signal**: One whale selling is a guess. Five whales selling is a trend.

Our **Election Dashboard** (coming soon) will aggregate these political signals specifically, giving you a realtime "Shadow Poll" that reflects money, not just opinions.
