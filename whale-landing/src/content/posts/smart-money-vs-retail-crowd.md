# The Divergence Indicator

One of the most powerful signals in any financial market is the divergence between **price action** and **sentiment**. In prediction markets like Polymarket, this often manifests as a battle between "Retail" and "Smart Money."

## The Retail Pattern

Retail traders typically trade based on:
- **Headlines**: Breaking news on Twitter or CNN.
- **Sentiment**: What the "crowd" feels is right.
- **Hope**: Betting on desired outcomes rather than probable ones.

This creates predictable waves of liquidity. Retail buys *after* the news, often pushing prices away from true probability.

## The Smart Money Signature

Whales operate differently. Their footprint often looks like this:
- **Limit Orders**: They provide liquidity rather than taking it aggressively, unless they are in a rush.
- **Contrarian Entries**: Buying "No" when the crowd screams "Yes" because the odds are mispriced.
- **Early Positioning**: Accumulating positions quietly days before a major catalyst.

## How We Help You Spot It

Whale Intelligence highlights moments where high-score wallets are taking positions *opposite* to the general market trend. 

If the price of "Candidate X wins" is rising, but our top-tier whales are selling, that's a red flag. It suggests the rally is fueled by emotion, not data.

Mastering this distinction is the first step to becoming a profitable prediction market trader.
