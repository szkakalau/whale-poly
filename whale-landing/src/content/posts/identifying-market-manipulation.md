# The Fake-Out

In unregulated or loosely regulated markets, manipulation is a reality. A wealthy entity might buy up shares to create the *appearance* of momentum, hoping to induce FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) from retail traders, only to dump their bags at a higher price.

## Signs of Manipulation

1.  **Volume without News**: Price spikes aggressively on zero new information.
2.  **Wash Trading**: High volume but price stays flat (traders selling to themselves).
3.  **The "Wall"**: Huge limit orders appearing and disappearing to spook the market.

## How Whale Intelligence Protects You

Our algorithms are designed to flag "organic" vs. "synthetic" movement.

- **Wallet Diversity**: If a price rise is driven by 100 different high-score wallets, it's likely genuine conviction. If it's driven by 1 fresh wallet funded via a mixer, it's suspicious.
- **Flow Analysis**: We track the *source* of funds. Smart money usually has a traceable history. Manipulators often use fresh, anonymous wallets.

## The "Trap" Setup

A common manipulation tactic is the "Trap." A whale pushes odds to 99% to trigger "Yes" buyers, then slams it down. By watching the **net position changes** of our top-tier whales, you can see if they are participating in the rally or quietly exiting into it.

If the price is going up, but the Smart Money is leaving... run.
