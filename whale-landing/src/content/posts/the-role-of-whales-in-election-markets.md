# The Whale's Vote

Election markets are the crown jewel of prediction markets. They attract the most volume, the most attention, and the biggest whales.

But do whales distort the odds, or do they correct them?

## Capital as Information

In efficient markets, capital is a proxy for conviction. When a whale deploys $500k on a candidate, they are signaling a strong belief in that outcome.

However, in political markets, we often see **ideological whales**—traders who bet based on preference rather than probability.

## Identifying Ideological vs. Rational Whales

Our algorithms look for specific patterns to differentiate these two types:

1.  **Price Sensitivity**: Rational whales buy when the price is good (e.g., buying "No" at 90¢ is better than selling "Yes" at 10¢ if liquidity differs). Ideological whales often market buy regardless of slippage.
2.  **Portfolio Diversity**: Rational whales often hedge or hold positions in unrelated markets. Ideological whales often have single-asset portfolios.
3.  **Timing**: Rational whales react to polls and news. Ideological whales often buy after their candidate has a "moment," even if the statistical impact is negligible.

## The "Smart Money" Bias

Historically, "Smart Money" (wallets with high PnL) tends to be less ideological. They treat candidates like stocks.

In the 2020 US Election, we observed that wallets with >$1M volume and >10% ROI were significantly more accurate in swing state predictions than the general crowd.

## Conclusion

When tracking election whales, check their history. Are they a political partisan or a profit-seeking mercenary? Follow the mercenaries.
