# Decoding the Whale Score

In the wild west of prediction markets, volume can be deceiving. A \$50,000 bet might look like "smart money," but what if it's just a wealthy novice chasing a Twitter rumor?

At **Whale Intelligence**, we don't just track volume; we track *competence*. Our proprietary **Whale Score** is the engine behind our alerts, designed to filter noise and highlight signal.

## The Components of a Score

Our algorithm considers multiple factors, not just the size of the bet:

1.  **Historical Accuracy**: Does this wallet have a track record of winning? A whale with a 30% win rate is a contrarian signal, while one with 80% demands attention.
2.  **Timing Advantage**: Did they buy *before* the news broke? Entries made hours or days before significant price shifts suggest information asymmetry.
3.  **Profitability**: Are they net positive over time? ROI matters more than raw win count.
4.  **Consistency**: Do they bet on everything, or do they snipe specific markets? Specialists often outperform generalists.

## Why It Matters

By aggregating these metrics into a single score (0-100), we give you an instant read on a trade's quality. 

- **Score < 40**: Likely noise or retail FOMO.
- **Score 40-70**: Worth watching, but verify with your own research.
- **Score > 80**: High-conviction signal. Historically, these wallets know something the market doesn't.

Don't just follow the money. Follow the *smart* money.
