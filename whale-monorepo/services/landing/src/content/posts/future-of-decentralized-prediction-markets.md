# Beyond Gambling

Right now, prediction markets are dominated by politics and crypto prices. But the technology (conditional tokens, AMMs, order books) has far-reaching implications.

## Futarchy: Governance by Market

Imagine a DAO or a government where policies are chosen based on market predictions.
- "Vote on a policy to lower inflation."
- Prediction markets estimate the impact of Policy A vs. Policy B.
- The policy with the best predicted outcome is automatically enacted.

## Corporate Decision Making

Companies like Google and Microsoft have experimented with internal prediction markets.
- "Will product launch X be delayed?"
- Employees bet anonymously.
- Management gets honest feedback, bypassing middle-manager optimism.

## Insurance and Hedging

Prediction markets can serve as micro-insurance.
- Farmers in Kenya can hedge against drought using a weather prediction market.
- Events organizers can hedge against rain.
- Crypto protocols can hedge against hacks.

## The Data Layer

Whale Intelligence is building the data layer for this future. As prediction markets become the global standard for truth and risk transfer, the data on *who* is predicting *what* becomes the most valuable commodity on earth. We are here to index it.
