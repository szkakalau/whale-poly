# Reading the Flow

Not every large buy is a smart buy. Some are hedges. Some are fat fingers. Some are just degenerate gambling.

To separate signal from noise, you need to look at three things:

## 1. Timing
Did the whale buy *before* a major news event or *after*? 
- **Pre-news**: Insider knowledge or superior research. (High Conviction)
- **Post-news**: Chasing the pump. (Low Conviction)

## 2. PnL History
Has this wallet made money before?
We track the PnL of every address. A $100k buy from a wallet down $500k all-time is a fade signal. A $10k buy from a wallet up $1M is a follow signal.

## 3. Holding Period
Smart money tends to hold. Dumb money flips. 
If a whale buys and holds through volatility, that is conviction.

## The Whale Score

We combine these factors into a single **Whale Score (0-100)**.
- **0-40**: Ignore. Likely noise.
- **40-70**: Monitor. Potential interest.
- **70+**: High Alert. Significant conviction from smart money.
