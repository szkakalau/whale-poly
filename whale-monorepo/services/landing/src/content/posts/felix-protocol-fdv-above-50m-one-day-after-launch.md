A central question in early token pricing: **Will Felix Protocol’s token have a fully diluted valuation (FDV) above $50,000,000 one day after launch?**  
This is an event‑driven setup defined by timing and valuation conventions; capital preferences and market microstructure shape the odds.

## Market Rules & Notes

- **FDV convention**: total supply × token price  
- **Launch definition**: token must be publicly transferable and tradable  
- **Timepoint**: **“one day after launch” = 4:00 PM ET on the calendar day following launch**; use the **most liquid price source** at that moment  
- **Fallback rule**: if the token hasn’t launched by **2026‑12‑31 11:59 PM ET**, the market resolves “No”

These conventions standardize valuation, window, and pricing source, preventing aberrant prints on thin venues from driving resolution.

## Bull Case: Why FDV > $50M can happen

1. **Low float supports high FDV**: at TGE, small circulating supply and limited depth let marginal buy pressure lift price; small price moves substantially raise FDV
2. **Narrative momentum & expectations**: clear roadmap and strong backers (build cadence, partnerships, LP commitments) drive early‑window demand
3. **Most‑liquid price source**: resolution prefers mature venues or cross‑market weighted prices, reflecting real demand over noise
4. **Window‑range trading**: the launch‑to‑next‑day window spans U.S./Asia/EU sessions, enabling global price discovery

## Bear Case: Why FDV ≤ $50M is plausible

1. **Rational pricing & market‑making**: conservative initial pricing and stable depth reduce emotional spikes; high FDV may not persist into resolution
2. **Supply, unlocks, and utility**: if supply, unlock cadence, or utility underwhelm, price is re‑anchored to function and cash‑flow, lowering FDV
3. **Consistent pricing source**: using the most liquid venue limits single‑exchange lifts, weakening the impact of brief pulses
4. **Timing risk & fallback**: delayed launch or technical/compliance issues trigger “No” via the fallback rule—a non‑trivial tail risk for Yes

## Whale Lens & Microstructure

- **Order‑book elasticity**: monitor top venues’ depth and cancel speeds to judge sustained buy interest vs. one‑off spikes  
- **Cross‑venue spreads & arb**: fast spread convergence signals real demand; persistent dispersion points to shallow depth  
- **Market‑maker pacing**: watch width changes around key moments (launch, next‑day midday, near 4:00 PM ET) for defense/lift tactics into resolution  
- **Information verification**: supply, utility, partnerships, and LP/strategic commitments determine whether price can hold into the checkpoint

At SightWhale, we don’t chase single headlines—we track **repeatable capital behavior**: stable wallets net‑buying across sessions and providing liquidity is more reliable than sentiment.

## Trader Checklist

- Initial total supply and circulating ratio (float/total)  
- Listing venues and identification of the “most liquid” source  
- Market‑making and LP programs (liquidity mining, maker subsidies)  
- Cross‑exchange spreads and stability (speed of convergence)  
- Order‑book structure near the checkpoint (4:00 PM ET next day)  
- Project progress and narrative delivery (builds, partnerships, metrics)

## Conclusion

The core is **realistic valuation at a specific timepoint**: not the absolute high, nor the launch instant, but the **next‑day 4:00 PM ET** price from the **most liquid source**.  
If you’re conservative, “No” benefits from time and fallback rules (delay/no launch). If you’re event‑momentum oriented, “Yes” is a short‑window bet on **low float × strong market‑making**.
