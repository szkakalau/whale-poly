# The Smartest Sports Bettors

Sports betting is a massive industry, but prediction markets offer a unique angle: liquidity-driven probabilities. Let's look at how whales navigated the last Super Bowl.

## Pre-Game Positioning

Two weeks before the game, we noticed a significant divergence.
- Public sentiment (social media) was heavily favoring Team A.
- **Whale Flow** was quietly accumulating Team B at attractive odds (45%).

## The "Sharps" vs. The Public

"Sharps" (professional bettors) often fade the public. In prediction markets, this manifests as limit orders stacking up against the retail flow.
- We observed a "buy wall" for Team B that absorbed millions in retail selling.
- This kept Team B's odds stable despite the public narrative.

## In-Game Adjustments

Prediction markets trade live.
- When Team A scored early, retail panic-sold Team B.
- Whales used this liquidity to *double down* on Team B at a discount.
- Our "Conviction Alert" fired when a known sharp wallet added $200k to their position while down 10 points.

## The Result

Team B won in overtime. The whales who bought the dip and held their conviction walked away with massive returns. The retail traders who panic-sold provided the exit liquidity.

**Lesson**: Trust the flow, not the scoreboard (until the end).
