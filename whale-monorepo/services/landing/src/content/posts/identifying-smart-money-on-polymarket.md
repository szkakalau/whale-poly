# Following the Right Wallets

Polymarket is transparent, but it's also noisy. Retail traders often chase headlines, creating "dumb money" waves. To find the "smart money," you need to look deeper.

## Characteristics of Smart Money

1.  **Early Entry**: Smart whales often position themselves *before* a narrative breaks into the mainstream. They buy when the probability is mispriced.
2.  **Limit Orders vs. Market Buys**: Sophisticated actors often use limit orders to build positions without slipping the price too much. Aggressive market buys are sometimes a sign of urgency (or panic).
3.  **Sizing**: It's not just about the absolute size. A $10k bet on a niche market might be more significant than a $50k bet on a high-volume election market.
4.  **Consistency**: Look for wallets with a high win rate over time, not just one lucky moonshot.

## On-Chain Forensics

We analyze transaction graphs to see:
- **Funding Sources**: Did the funds come from a known exchange, a mixer, or a smart contract?
- **Related Wallets**: Is this wallet part of a larger cluster acting in unison?

## The "Whale Intelligence" Edge

Our algorithms automatically flag these patterns. We don't just show you large trades; we show you trades that have a statistical probability of being "smart." By filtering out the noise, you can focus on the signals that actually move the needle.
