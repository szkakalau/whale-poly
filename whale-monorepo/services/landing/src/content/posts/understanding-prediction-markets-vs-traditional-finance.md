# The Truth Machine

In traditional finance (TradFi), prices reflect the value of assets—stocks, bonds, commodities. In prediction markets, prices reflect **probabilities**.

When you buy a share of Apple, you are betting the company will grow. When you buy "Yes" on a Polymarket outcome, you are betting an event will happen. The price (e.g., 60 cents) directly translates to a probability (60%).

## Skin in the Game

The core difference is "skin in the game." Pundits on TV can say whatever they want with zero financial consequence. In a prediction market, being wrong costs money. This financial incentive filters out noise and incentivizes accurate information discovery.

## Efficiency and Speed

Prediction markets often react faster than news outlets.
- **News**: Needs verification, editorial approval, and publishing time.
- **Markets**: React instantly to insider knowledge, rumors, and on-chain data.

## Why Whales Matter Here

In TradFi, institutional flows are hidden in dark pools. In prediction markets (especially crypto-native ones like Polymarket), every transaction is on-chain. This transparency allows us to track "smart money" in real-time.

At Whale Intelligence, we believe prediction markets are the future of information. Tracking the whales who move these markets is the key to unlocking that future.
