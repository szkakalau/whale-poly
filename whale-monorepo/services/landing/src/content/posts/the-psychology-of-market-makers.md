# The Invisible Hand

Market Makers (MMs) are the engines of prediction markets. They provide the "Yes" and "No" orders that allow you to trade instantly. But they aren't charities; they are in it to make money on the spread.

## How MMs Think

MMs don't necessarily care who wins. They care about:
1.  **Inventory Risk**: They don't want to hold too much of one side. If they buy too much "Yes," they will lower the price to encourage people to buy "Yes" (taking it off their hands) or raise the price of "No."
2.  **Volatility**: MMs widen spreads during high volatility to protect themselves.
3.  **Adverse Selection**: They fear trading against someone who knows more than they do (i.e., a Whale).

## Spotting MM Behavior

- **Tight Spreads**: Indicates MMs are comfortable and volume is balanced.
- **Widening Spreads**: Indicates uncertainty or an incoming news event.
- **Price Drifts**: Sometimes MMs will slowly drift the price to test liquidity at different levels.

## Trading with MMs

- **Don't be a liquidity taker unless necessary**: Use limit orders to capture the spread like an MM.
- **Watch for the "Retreat"**: If MMs suddenly pull their liquidity, it's a major red flag. It means they expect a volatility nuke.

At Whale Intelligence, we track liquidity depth changes to gauge MM sentiment. When the MMs get nervous, you should too.
