# The Blockchain is a Truth Serum

In traditional finance, data is siloed. In crypto prediction markets, every move is recorded on a public ledger (Polygon, in Polymarket's case). This offers a treasure trove of sentiment data.

## Stablecoin Inflows

We monitor the flow of USDC into the Polymarket proxy contracts.
- **Net Inflow**: Fresh capital entering the ecosystem. Bullish for overall market activity.
- **Net Outflow**: Capital leaving. Often a sign of risk-off sentiment.

## Wallet Age and Activity

- **New Wallets**: A surge of new wallets often signals retail FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out). This can be a contrarian indicator (time to sell?).
- **Dormant Wallets Waking Up**: When a wallet that hasn't traded in 6 months suddenly deposits $500k, pay attention. They are back for a specific reason.

## Token Holdings

We also look at what *else* a wallet holds.
- A wallet holding heavily speculative memecoins might be a "gambler."
- A wallet holding mostly stablecoins and blue-chip DeFi tokens might be a "conservative investor."

## Sentiment Analysis at Scale

Whale Intelligence aggregates millions of data points to create a "Market Sentiment Score." This isn't based on tweets or news; it's based on hard money flows. When the money talks, we listen.
