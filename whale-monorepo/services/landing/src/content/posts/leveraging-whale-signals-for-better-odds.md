# Hybrid Investing

Blindly following whales (copy-trading) can work, but the best strategy is **Hybrid Investing**. This combines your own fundamental thesis with the confirmation of smart money flow.

## The Confluence Setup

1.  **Your Thesis**: You believe "Candidate X" is undervalued because of a new demographic trend.
2.  **The Signal**: You wait. You don't buy yet. You watch Whale Intelligence.
3.  **The Trigger**: A known high-PnL wallet starts buying "Candidate X."
4.  **Execution**: You enter the trade.

## Why Wait?

- **Timing**: You might be right, but early. Whales often have better timing. Waiting for their move saves you from opportunity cost.
- **Validation**: If you have a thesis but *no* smart money is moving, you might be missing a crucial counter-argument.

## Sizing Up

When your research aligns with whale flow, that is a **High Conviction Setup**. This is when you size up.
- **Research Only**: 1x Position Size.
- **Whale Signal Only**: 1x Position Size.
- **Research + Whale Signal**: 3x Position Size.

## Exit Strategy

Use whales for exits too. If your thesis is still valid but whales start dumping, take profit. They might know about a black swan event that you don't.
