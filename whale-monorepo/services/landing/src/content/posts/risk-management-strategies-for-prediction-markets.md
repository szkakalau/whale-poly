# Surviving the Variance

Prediction markets are binary options. You either win $1.00 or you get $0.00. This binary nature creates extreme volatility. Without proper risk management, you *will* go to zero, no matter how good your signals are.

## The Kelly Criterion

The Golden Rule of sizing. Don't bet more than your edge allows.
- If you have a 60% chance of winning a bet priced at 50 cents, the Kelly Criterion suggests a specific bet size.
- In practice, use "Fractional Kelly" (e.g., half-Kelly) to reduce volatility.

## Diversification

Don't put your entire bankroll on one election or one sports game. Whales diversify across multiple uncorrelated markets (e.g., Politics, Crypto Prices, Pop Culture) to smooth out their equity curve.

## Hedging

Smart whales often hedge.
- If they are long "Trump to Win," they might short "Republican Popular Vote" as a hedge.
- If they are betting on a crypto price rise, they might short the perp on a CEX to capture the premium difference.

## The Stop Loss Dilemma

Traditional stop losses are hard in binary markets because liquidity can dry up.
- **Mental Stops**: Have a price invalidation level. If the odds drop below X%, accept that your thesis is wrong and exit.
- **Time Stops**: If the event hasn't happened by a certain date, close the position.

Whale Intelligence helps you spot when the "smart money" is exiting, giving you an early warning to cut your losses.
