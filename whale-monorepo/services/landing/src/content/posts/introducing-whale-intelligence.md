# The Edge of Smart Money

Prediction markets are noisy. Twitter is noisy. 

In a world where everyone has an opinion, capital is the only truth teller. **Whale Intelligence** was built to track that truth.

## Why We Built This

We noticed a pattern in Polymarket:
1. News breaks.
2. Retail traders panic buy/sell.
3. A few large wallets quietly accumulate the opposite side.
4. The market settles in favor of the whales.

We built a system to track these wallets automatically. Now, we are opening it up to you.

## What to Expect

- **Real-time Alerts**: Know when a whale enters a position.
- **Historical Backtesting**: See which whales have a high win rate.
- **Conviction Scores**: Not all trades are equal. We score them.

Stay tuned for more updates.
